# 🛒 React Shopping Cart SPA

A single-page application built with **React** to demonstrate modern front-end architecture, state management, and routing patterns.  
This project focuses on clean separation of concerns, strong TypeScript typing, and scalable state handling using React Context and `useReducer`.

## ✨ Features

- Client-side routing with **React Router**
- Data loading using **React Router loaders**
- Global state management with **useReducer + Context**
- Strongly typed application using **TypeScript**
- Modular, maintainable component structure
- Fully client-side single-page application (SPA)
- integration tests (in progress)
